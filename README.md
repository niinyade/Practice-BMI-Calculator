# Practice-BMI-Calculator
BMI Calculator practice and all layout provided by Angela Yu.

The goal of this tutorial is to learn more about Optionals, solidify mine understanding of the MVC design pattern and to introduce the concept of Classes.
I’ll compare objects created from classes with instances of Structs that I learnt about earlier.

Topics learnt:

¬ How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.

¬ Optional binding, optional chaining and the nil coalescing operator.

¬ How to create classes and difference between classes and structs.

¬ Pass by value vs. pass by reference.

¬ Formatting Strings.

¬ Color literals.
